# Ethereum - Everything you need to know

# Setup

We will be using a VM running Ubuntu 16.04 with WMware Workstation Player

### Install Node.js and npm

> sudo apt-get install curl  
> curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -  
> sudo apt-get install -y nodejs  
> sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

Hence we should have node.js v8.x installed

> node --version
> v8.9.1


### Install testrpc

Using 4.1.3 ATM, due to issues with gasLimit on contract creation

> npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc@4.1.3


### Install solcjs and solc

There are actually two Solidity compilers: solc, written in C++, and solc-js, which uses Emscripten to cross-compile from the solc C++ source code to JavaScript. Technically theyâ€™re built from the same source code, but in practice they appear to produce slightly different results. They also have different command line interfaces, and solcjs is (as expected) quite a bit slower than solc.  
First we start with 'solcjs'

> npm install -g solc 

Additionally, we install the command line compiler 'solc' 

> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum  
> sudo apt-get update  
> sudo apt-get install solc

### Install geth


> sudo apt-get install software-properties-common  
> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum  
> sudo apt-get update  
> sudo apt-get install ethereum


### Setup project

> mkdir <your_project_name>  
> cd <your_project_name>  
> npm init

Configure your npm project

> npm install ethereum/web3.js --save

## Running

Start the full client simulator

> testrpc

Head with your browser of choice to 'remix.ethereum.org'  
As Environment choose 'Web3 Provider' and connect to 'localhost:8545'
